A music project intended to create a whole <b>'synthwave'</b> song only with generated sounds and synths, as well as sampled processed recordings. The sounds are generated, sampled and processed with the help of <b>SuperCollider</b> as a main environment and programming language. The sounds are arranged and recorded with <b>DAWs</b> (Digital Audio Workstations) such as <b>Abelton and Cubase</b>.
